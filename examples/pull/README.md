# TSP Codes

This example demonstrates retrieving TSP codes.  You will need the following environment variables:

* `SMART_BONDING_USERNAME` - the user name given to access the service
* `SMART_BONDING_PASSWORD` - the associated password for the username

> Note: these can be provided in a `.env` file.

By default, this will connect to the test endpoint, and then:
* retrieve the first 5 entries and print them out;
* retrieve all entries and print the number of items retrieved.
